# Bearded Vulture GPS Flight Path Visualization

This project visualizes 3D GPS flight paths of bearded vultures, including multiple individuals, using Python. It supports both 2D and 3D visualizations for visually appealing analysis.

## Project Structure
- `data/` — Store GPS datasets (CSV, JSON, etc.)
- `scripts/` — Python scripts for data processing and visualization
- `visualizations/` — Output plots and animations

## Setup
1. Install Python 3.8+
2. Recommended packages: matplotlib, plotly, pandas, numpy
3. Place your GPS data files in the `data/` folder

## Usage
- Run scripts in the `scripts/` folder to generate visualizations
- Outputs will be saved in `visualizations/`

## Next Steps
- Implement 2D and 3D visualization scripts
- Add interactive and animated features
