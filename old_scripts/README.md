## üîÑ **Migration Guide**

### **Instead of old scripts, use:**

| Old Script | New Professional Version |
|------------|--------------------------|
| `plot_2d.py` | `animate_live_map_professional.py` |
| `plot_3d.py` | `animate_3d.py` (kept in main scripts) |
| `animate_2d.py` | `animate_live_map_professional.py` |
| `animate_live_map_optimized.py` | `animate_live_map_professional.py` |
| `animate_mobile_map_optimized.py` | `animate_mobile_map_professional.py` |

## üìù **Why These Scripts Were Archived**

- **Code Quality**: Professional versions have better error handling, type hints, and documentation
- **Performance**: Professional versions include advanced optimization features
- **User Experience**: Professional versions have guided workflows and better feedback
- **Maintainability**: Professional versions follow best practices and are easier to extend
- **Functionality**: Professional versions include all features from old scripts plus enhancements

## üîß **If You Need to Use Old Scripts**

These scripts should still work with the current data format, but you may need to:

1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Ensure data is in the correct format (CSV with semicolon separator)
3. Run from the project root directory

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**

These archived scripts are no longer actively maintained. For new development and production use, please use the professional versions in the main `scripts/` folder.

**Recommended professional scripts:**
- `scripts/animate_live_map_professional.py` - Desktop visualization
- `scripts/animate_mobile_map_professional.py` - Mobile-optimized visualization
